<!-- Brief overview of this repo -->
## Overview
This project aims to create an autonomous robot capable of playing an intelligent, over-the-board game of chess against a human opponent. The system uses a three-axis, cantilevered, overhead gantry to move parallel to the chess board. Each axis is driven by a stepper motor, the horizontal axes using belts and the vertical axis using a rack and pinion. A crosspoint array of reed switches embedded in the physical chess board allows for piece detection, and with software record of the board state, piece recognition. This system is orchestrated by an [MSP432E401Y](https://www.ti.com/product/MSP432E401Y) microcontroller, with chess moves being pulled from the open-source [Stockfish](https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish) chess engine, running on a [Raspberry Pi 3A+](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-a-plus/). All communication between the Raspberry Pi and MSP432 is done through a universal asynchronous receiver-transmitter (UART) serial connection.

This repository contains all code running on the Raspberry Pi to interface with the Stockfish chess engine, written in Python.

## UART Protocol
In this project, the MSP432 and Raspberry Pi communicate with each other via UART. A custom instruction protocol has been created to define the various instructions that can be exchanged. In this protocol, every UART message takes the form of an instruction with the following [format](https://i.imgur.com/gRhEl1u.png): 
- 1 start byte (0x0A)
- 1 byte containing the instruction ID and operand length
  - Upper 4 bits reserved for the instruction ID
  - Lower 4 bits reserved for the operand length
- n bytes containing the operand (if applicable), where n equals the operand length defined in the previous byte (0 <= n <= 5)
- 2 bytes containing the [Fletcher-16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fletcher's_checksum#Implementation) checksum bytes.
